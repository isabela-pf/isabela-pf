Iâ€™m Isabela (she/her), UX/UI designer officially and a professional question-asker by 
self-proclamation. You may also know me as an admirer of the color orange, 
proponent of floral patterns, and generally curious person.

Iâ€™m fortunate to work at [Quansight Labs](https://labs.quansight.org/) and spend 
most (but certainly not all) of my time in the [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/) 
and [Spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder) communities. Accessibility, 
community, and supporting new and underrepresented people are a few of the 
things that matter to me.

A few places on Github you might find me are [jupyter/accessibility](https://github.com/jupyter/accessibility/) 
and [spyder-ide/ux-improvements](https://github.com/spyder-ide/ux-improvements/).

It's nice to meet you! Feel free to reach out by leaving an issue on [this repo](https://github.com/isabela-pf/isabela-pf).
