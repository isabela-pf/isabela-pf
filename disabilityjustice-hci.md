# Community workshops as open source accessibility

Over a year, a team of designers have organized [reproducible public workshops](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyter-accessibility-workshops) 
to add image descriptions to international [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) 
scientific software projects. These events gather participants to surface 
accessibility needs, share experiential knowledge, contribute accessibility 
improvements, and develop field-specific documentation. This creates a 
reciprocal relationship; the designers have an opportunity for informal 
qualitative research, while participants immediately benefit from the addition 
of image descriptions based on their feedback.

While image description guidelines already exist, scientific open source 
communities seldom engage with them. Once prompted, many feel unsure how to 
apply such guidelines to their varied images. When software continues to be 
inaccessible, this can impact the careers of disabled people, especially in 
scientific fields where these tools are standard. Our events partner needs of 
disabled people—to have accessible tools—with needs of the tools’ maintainers—
further guidance and support for accessibility.

These workshops include the following: an introduction to image descriptions,
examples of image descriptions in scientific contexts, time for questions, 
collaborative practice of these skills in a no-code environment, contributed 
changes to a project.

To date, we have worked with projects like [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), 
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), 
and [Dask](https://dask.org/), indispensable software in contemporary 
scientific research across fields—including AI/ML development. So far 
we have centered image descriptions, but the format lends itself to any 
combination of one-line code changes and foundational accessibility 
practices.

In terms of results, the workshop produces image descriptions, multiple new 
contributors, and [documentation for the wider scientific community](https://accessibility.scientific-python.org/reference.html). 
While they are not quantifiable, our workshops have prompted other events, 
accessibility audits, and code fixes based on community members’ newfound 
knowledge. In a space where accessibility has been an afterthought, this 
community accountability is a critical initiative towards disability justice 
in individual projects, open source, and scientific careers as a whole.
